1. using “ // ” 
     Comments are used to explain the code written. They do not execute when the program is running. 
 
2. int main() 
 
3. scanf is used to read data that is inputted by the user. 
 
4. Yes, c language is a case sensitive language. In C language capitalization, identifiers, keywords     matter. 
 
5. Valid identifiers 
 record1 
 name 
 name_and_address 
 return  
    Invalid identifiers 
 1record – the first character cannot be a digit 
 $tax – identifier cannot start with a symbol 
 name and address – identifiers cannot contain spaces 
 file-3 – identifiers cannot contain hyphens 
 123-45-6789  -  identifiers cannot contain hyphens 
 
6. 
a) False, if we want to print next line in a new line we have to use “\n” in the end of the quoted printf statement. 
 
b) False, comments do not print anything on screen 
c.) True, \n is used to begin in a new line. 
d) True. All variables must be declared before using it in the code. 
e) True, variables must be given a type when they are declaring like int, char, float. 
f) False. C is a case sensitive language therefore it does not identify ‘number’ as ‘NuMbEr’. 
g) False. Three lines can be printed using single print statement.

a) scanf(“d”,&value); 
b) printf(“The product of %d and %d is %d  \n”,x,y,z); 
c) scanf(“%d“,&anInteger ); 
d) printf(“Remainder of %d divided by %d is %d \n”,x,y,x5y); 
e) printf(“The sum is %d \n”,x+y); 
f) printf(“The value you entered is: %d \n”,value); 
 
9. 
a) 2 
b) 4 
c) x= 
d) x=2 
e) 5=5 
f) Nothing 
g) Nothing 
h) Nothing 
i) Nothing 
 
10. 
a) False, they are evaluated according to their precedence and associativity. 
b) True 
c) False, this is a print statement 
d) False, the order of evaluation of a valid arithmetic expression containing no parenthesis is also not specified. Compiler is free to evaluate expressions in any order. 
e) False , 3g,87,67h2 and 2h are invalid variables but h22 is valid variable in c.
