1. A programming language is a set of instructions given to a computer about what to do. Here are some reasons why programming is important. 
            i. To solve problems – programming languages can be used to solve problems that is                                                    difficult to solve manually. 
             ii. To automate tasks – programming languages can be used to do tasks that was done manually earlier. 
 
Furthermore, programming languages are used in many occasions. 
 1.software development 
 2.data science 
 3.web development 
 4.game development    etc.

Source code vs. machine code 
• Source code is set of instructions written in a programming language that can be read by humans. 
• Machine code is a set of instructions that are written in a language that can be understand by computer only.  
 
High level language vs. Low level language  
• High level language can be easily recognized by humans and is easy to design. 
• Low level language can’t be easily understand by humans but it is easily executed by computers. 
 
Compiler vs. Interpreter 
• Compiler is program that translates high level language into machine language. 
• Interpreter is a program that executes high level language programs line by line. 
 
Structured language vs. Object orientated language. 
• Structured language is a language that uses structured programming techniques like functions and procedures to organize code. 
• Object orientated language ins a language that uses objects to organize code. Objects are self-contained units of code that contain data and methods. 
 
C vs. C++ 
• C is a structured programming language that used for system applications and low-level programming applications, and it is known for its efficiency and performance. 
• C++ is an object orientated programming language having some additional features like data hiding, data abstraction, inheritance, etc. 
 
C++ vs. Java 
• C++ is used more in large scale developments like banks and governments.  
• java is used more often in consumer products like apps, software, and video games. 
 
Syntax error vs. Logical error 
• Syntax error is a mistake in the grammar of a programming language. 
• Logical error is mistake in the logic of a programming language problem.
